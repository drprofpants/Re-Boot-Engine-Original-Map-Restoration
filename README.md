Hi, my name is Miles (drprofpants), and I forked this project with the intent on making the original super metroid map in Re-Boot-Engine.
I don't know anything about Gamemaker studio, and such coding languages assosiated with this project, but it is what I think I can try to contribute to. 

I would also ask you if someone finds this to respect scooterboot's wishes as to not cover it on a Youtube 
video, or highly publicise it. It would greatly hurt the project if Nintendo decided to strike this, so 
only admire or contribute.
